The first step is to create the dataset by pulling values and generating
the rate of change of interest (i.e., log-returns)

In this case we are going to use the stock prices for two companies in the
information technology industry in particular the Data & Processing and
outsourced services (i.e., Paycheck inc. and PayPal), one company in the
Consumer Staples industry (i.e., Walmart), one market (i.e., S&P 500) and
the risk-free rates for 2019 provided by the US Department of Treasury.
